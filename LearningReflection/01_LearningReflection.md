> Please use the below questions as guidelines to help you think and plan your Learning Reflection Report

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?
- The testing experience was ok. Had to use Google to find some of the buttons I wanted to use like change project name and delete.

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case?
- I tested and followed the steps and edited the test cases as needed. If there was an extra button or somethign I did not expect.  

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management, 
 - This is a bit messy way of doing it so maybe just not have so many documents here in the assignment but make it clear with less text.

## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?
- Visual studio code is my favorite

## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?
- I did not find all buttons I wanted, so used Google to help find my way in Gitlab.

## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?
-I have used github in coding many times before. On other courses.

## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )
- I am not so familiar with these frameworks, but as the material did recomend using Robot framework and it can be used with my favorite tool Visual studio code with plugins, I would probably do that. 

## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing
- Tester: Communication skills, analytical and logical mindset, project management skills, ability to follow procedures, interpersonal skills, attention to detail, eagerness to learn, excellen time management and prioritization.
Automation: Proficiency in programming languages, sufficient knowledge of automation tools, clearly understanding busines requirements, knowledge of test management tools, Agile / DevOps/ Continuous delivery expertise.

## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?
- I would need to read up and learn everything. I have learned the beginning of it until now but nothing that I could confidently put on my CV yet. 

## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and  Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 
- I think that this project was very practical. I think I understood it correctly and that I have done it correctly. A good excersise on the end of a course in addition to all the theory learned earlier.
